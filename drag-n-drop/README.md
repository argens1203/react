This project is a demostration of a very intuitive UI design of a list of items using React (on Web).

It has 6 blocks which can be instantiated with 'INITBLOCKS' which can then be dragged around, re-prioritize, re-child and delete with by dragging and dropping.

## TODO
- write tests
- github actions
